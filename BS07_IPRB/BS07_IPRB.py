Mendel's First Law
Given: Three positive integers k, m, and n, representing a population containing k+m+n organisms: k individuals are
homozygous dominant for a factor, m are heterozygous, and n are homozygous recessive.

Return: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant
allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.
